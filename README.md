## Description
Welcome to the Rizz-O-Matic! It is a "rizz" generator where users can save a silly quote, post it, </br>
and comment on. Created with MERN architecture, Bootstap CSS, and uploaded to Heroku. </br>
Info is saved and loaded from MongoDB, and ChatGPT is integrated as the generator. </br>

Front-End: </br>
    - React JS </br>
    - Vite </br>
    - Bootstrap 5 CSS </br>
    - CSS </br>
    - tsParticles </br>

Back-End: </br>
    - MongoDB </br>
    - Express.js </br>
    - Node.js </br>
    - ApolloServer/GraphQL </br>
    - ChatGPT API (openAI) </br>

## What We Have Learned
We learned a lot about incorporating a MERN architecture into a group project scenario. </br>
Configuring MongoDB to connect through both front-end and back-end, along with GraphQL </br>
and our ChatGPT API, was a process. Express.js and Node.js are known fairly well by this point. </br>
React was exciting to utilize in new ways, such as implementing background particles through tsParticles, </br>
and adding a typing animation for the 'rizz generator' for a cool effect. </br>
Heroku was finnicky about code order, build packs, and attaching dynos, but </br>
it was eventually figured out with a lot of testing, rewriting, and repeating, </br>
until the project finally worked in a web environment. </br>

## Future Development
Though we only had a week for development, and only two of us working on this project, </br>
several ideas floated around about what we could improve on in the future. </br>
We could expand the scope of the 'rizz' generator to other possible generators, </br>
such as dating tips. We could incorporate sharing capabilities with social media platforms </br>
for users to directly post/share their generated quotes. An on-site chat or friends list </br>
could make the website more community-focused. We could adapt the site to be more </br>
mobile-friendly, make it an app to access instead. </br>

---Thanks--- </br>
Huge thanks to Diem Ly, one of our amazing </br>
TAs, and Leah Nelson (https://github.com/LeahNelson), our professor, </br>
both from the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp program for fall 2023! </br>
They provided so much assistance in getting our website to </br>
launch on Heroku, and without them, we would never have been </br>
able to get the Rizz-O-Matic up and running. </br>
Especially Diem, who came up with the idea in the first place </br>
for us to implement, and worked with us for 4 hours straight </br>
on the last class day. ❤️ </br>
